managers should be able to create the meetings and add the employees in selection like multiple employees on creation of meeting the employees should receive an email and in app chat message automatically with the link for the meeting a google link should be created with managers account

And also after creating a task and if an employee manager assigns the tasks to more employees there should be messages in the chatbox as well

Implement the read receipts single tick to send and double tick to read
Also show if the user is online near the profile icon and name while chatting and the typing status in yellow dots in realtime in chat with bubble like apple does on the iPhone

		
Fix the footer it should be down at the bottom in the chat and below urls

http://127.0.0.1:5010/chat/

http://127.0.0.1:5010/chat/direct/2
	


Can you integrate a free api that privides the calendar information such as holidays and other stuff to work upon



And the employees should be able to ask for the leaves from managers and managers should  be able to ask for the leaves from the admin in the chat (add an option along side to selecting images icon to ask for leave icon)


An employee should only have a specified number of leaves selected by their manager and for the manager the admin should specify the number of leaves
