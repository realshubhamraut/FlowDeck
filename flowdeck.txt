managers should be able to create the meetings and add the employees in selection like multiple employees on creation of meeting the employees should receive an email and in app chat message automatically with the link for the meeting a google link should be created with managers account

And the employees should be able to ask for the leaves from managers and managers should  be able to ask for the leaves from the admin in the chat (add an option along side to selecting images icon to ask for leave icon)


An employee should only have a specified number of leaves selected by their manager and for the manager the admin should specify the number of leaves
