## ⚙️ Known Limitations

### 🟡 Remaining Templates Needed (32 templates)

The backend is 100% functional, but some UI pages still need to be created:

- **Task Management:** Kanban board, create/edit forms, task detail view
- **Chat Interface:** 5 templates for team messaging
- **Admin Panel:** 10 templates for system administration
- **User Profiles:** 6 templates for user management
- **Auth Pages:** Registration, password reset
- **Public Pages:** About, contact, pricing

**Note:** All backend routes for these pages already exist and work via API!

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Port 5000 Already in Use?
FlowDeck is configured to use port **5001** to avoid conflicts with macOS AirPlay Receiver.

### Database Errors?
Reinitialize the database:
```bash
rm instance/flowdeck.db
flask init-db
flask seed
```

### Package Installation Errors?
The installation script handles Python 3.13 compatibility. If issues persist:
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Application Not Starting?
Check for error messages in the terminal. Common issues:
- Port already in use (change `FLASK_PORT` in `.env`)
- Missing environment variables (check `.env` file)
- Database not initialized (run `flask init-db`)
